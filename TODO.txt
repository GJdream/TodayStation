- Display busy indicator while downloading.
- clock 12/24 hour
- wunderground: maybe display "observation_location"?
- Is there any way to detect celsius/fahrenheit from locale?
- Calender date header: Right align the date portion, day portion is left-aligned.
- Calender entries: left align time, right align title?
  - Or maybe just offset title to a consistent location (enough space for time).
- Initial display is sneaking in surrogates from storyboard... (At least clock)
- call pause code when leaving foreground
- On return from background, update weather and calendar.
- EKEventStoreChangedNotification does not have coalesce. :(
  Need to implement some kind of anti-jitter.
  Maybe: After receiving message...wait for a certain period of time, ignoring
  messages, and then fire.
- Line (or something) separating midnight in hourly view.

MAJOR:
- Auto find location.
- Icons
- What to do with space around hourly information.
- Error handling.
