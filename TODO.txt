- Display busy indicator while downloading.
- Calender date header: Right align the date portion, day portion is left-aligned.
- Calender entries: left align time, right align title?
  - Or maybe just offset title to a consistent location (enough space for time).
- Initial display is sneaking in surrogates from storyboard... (At least clock)
- call pause code when leaving foreground
- EKEventStoreChangedNotification does not have coalesce. :(
  Need to implement some kind of anti-jitter.
  Maybe: After receiving message...wait for a certain period of time, ignoring
  messages, and then fire.
- Line (or something) separating midnight in hourly view.
- Handle color changes:
  - Settings button.
  - Separator lines.
- City selector: Add GPS button to auto search.

MAJOR:
- Icons
- What to do with space around hourly information (2 column sucks).
- Error handling.
- On return from background, update weather and calendar.
